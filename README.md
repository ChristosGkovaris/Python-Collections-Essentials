# Python Essentials

Welcome to the "Python Essentials" repository, where you'll find a collection of Python scripts covering various concepts .


## Code Instructions
- Objective: The scripts in this repository demonstrate practical Python applications including sorting, searching, inserting, and formatting data.
- How to Play: Simply run the Python scripts and interact with the inputs as prompted. Each script performs different operations depending on the task (e.g., sorting a list, inserting a new item into a tuple, etc.).
- Feedback: You can modify the input data or tweak the logic to suit different needs. Feel free to experiment with the scripts.


## Implementation Details
- The `describe_items` function iterates over a nested dictionary of food items and returns a list of formatted strings based on a specified color filter.
- The `find_winner` function computes the average scores of players and identifies the player with the highest average.
- The `insert_item` function inserts a new item into a tuple at a specified index.
- The `build_menu` function adds a new cake item to a dictionary, sorts the cakes in reverse alphabetical order, and formats the result as a menu list.
- The `prepare_list` function takes a list of animals, deduplicates it using a set, and sorts the items alphabetically.


## How to Run
- Clone the Repository:
  ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/ChristosGkovaris/Python-Collections-Essentials.git
     cd Python-Collections-Essentials
